This was our third visit to the park. Despite some illness, we still managed to have a great time.</p><p><em>RooTwo</em> is 4 months and I think we’d forgotten what a mission holidays are with babies. Not that I’m complaining. First world problems and all that. Still, we <em>did</em> have to buy a roof-box for the trip.</p><p>Oh and it was also his <strong>first holiday</strong>!</p><h2>Monday</h2><p>It’s a two-and-a-half hour drive to Woburn Forest. Thankfully traffic was light and <em>RooTwo</em> slept. We let <em>Roo</em> burn off pent-up car energy in the playground. We settled into our lodge and put the kids to bed. <em>RooTwo</em> has just started moving around more. He had a bit of an unsettled night with his head jammed against the too-small cot bars.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--span-both"><div class="m_figure__gallery" data-gallery><a href="/images/articles/70/large_roos.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="4032" data-height="3024"><img src="/images/articles/70/large_roos.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="All the Roos on the day we arrived."> </a><a href="/images/articles/70/large_playground1.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="3024" data-height="4032"><img src="/images/articles/70/large_playground1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo enjoying the playground."> </a><a href="/images/articles/70/large_playground2.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="4032" data-height="3024"><img src="/images/articles/70/large_playground2.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo and RooTwo on a swing."></a></div><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionNumber">1.</span> All the Roos on the day we arrived. <span class="m_figure__captionNumber">2.</span> Roo enjoying the playground. <span class="m_figure__captionNumber">3.</span> Roo and RooTwo on a swing.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tuesday</h2><p>Tuesday started slow. <em>Roo</em> and I got out after breakfast into the small wooded area at the back of the lodge. I say small but to her it was magical. As full of mystery as any fairytale forest. We made up a game where you had to catch each-other by moving from tree-to-tree. It was great fun. She’s really smart and I love her for it.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--pull-both"><div class="m_figure__gallery" data-gallery><a href="/images/articles/70/large_woods1.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="4032" data-height="3024"><img src="/images/articles/70/woods1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo in a den we found.

That’s how they get you! She loved mixing bat blood with dried bogeys to produce a volcano. And she loved being enclosed in a giant bubble. We loved how freaking cute she looked in that tiny labcoat.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--pull-both"><div class="m_figure__gallery" data-gallery><a href="/images/articles/70/large_science1.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="3024" data-height="4032"><img src="/images/articles/70/science1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo is enclosed in a giant bubble."> </a><a href="/images/articles/70/large_science2.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="3024" data-height="4032"><img src="/images/articles/70/science2.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo in labcoat and the protective goggles I made her wear for the photo."></a></div><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionNumber">1.</span> Roo is enclosed in a giant bubble. <span class="m_figure__captionNumber">2.</span> Roo in labcoat and the protective goggles I made her wear for the photo.</figcaption></figure><p>By late afternoon Katie was feeling crap. Breastfeeding is tough at the best of times. But recently it has just been a whole lot worse. And a bout of mastitus was the last thing she needed. Luckily, Center Parcs has on-site nursing staff. They quickly sorted an appointment with a local GP. A few hours later we were back at the lodge, antibiotics in hand.</p><h2>Wednesday</h2><p>It’s almost like <em>RooTwo</em> knew mummy wasn’t well. He had a great night’s sleep. Well done that boy. Still, Katie wasn’t in any shape to do much. I took <em>Roo</em> for some early morning cake decorating. This was brilliant! Although we did run out of time at the end.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--pull-both"><div class="m_figure__gallery" data-gallery><a href="/images/articles/70/large_cakes1.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="4032" data-height="3024"><img src="/images/articles/70/cakes1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo rolling out some icing for her piggy cake."> </a><a href="/images/articles/70/large_cakes2.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="3024" data-height="4032"><img src="/images/articles/70/cakes2.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo puts the finishing touches to her pink piggy cake.

Which was disappointing as it took <em>way</em> longer to put away than it did to set up. Later, we went swimming. This is always really great. <em>Roo’s</em> favourites were the lazy river and wave machine. It was dark on the way back so we had an adventure trying to find our cabin.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--pull-both"><div class="m_figure__gallery" data-gallery><a href="/images/articles/70/large_stringmaze.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="4032" data-height="3024"><img src="/images/articles/70/stringmaze.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo solving the string maze I built for her."> </a><a href="/images/articles/70/large_nightwalk.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="4032" data-height="3024"><img src="/images/articles/70/nightwalk.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo posing by one of the low-lighters on the path back to our cabin."></a></div><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionNumber">1.</span> Roo solving the string maze I built for her. <span class="m_figure__captionNumber">2.</span> Roo posing by one of the low-lighters on the path back to our cabin.</figcaption></figure><h2>Thursday</h2><p>Katie was feeling a little better. All four of us went to watch <em>Roo</em> enjoy Off-Road Explorers. This was the best activity of the week. No one else was booked so <em>Roo</em> had the entire course to herself. The instructor was a lovely chap and took the time to make the experience special. There’s nothing quite like the look on your child’s face when they’re truly delighted. She loved every second of driving round the mini off-road course. It might just be proud parent in me talking but by the end she was pretty good.</p><p><em>RooTwo</em> is loving a bit of time in the sling. He’s big enough to face forwards now. He really seems to appreciate the view and we enjoy the cuddles. My big boy is growing so fast.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--pull-both"><div class="m_figure__gallery" data-gallery><a href="/images/articles/70/large_ladymuck.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="4032" data-height="3024"><img src="/images/articles/70/ladymuck.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo, aka Lady Muck, clearly enjoying her time on the off-road explorers activity."> </a><a href="/images/articles/70/large_meandtheboy.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="2316" data-height="3088"><img src="/images/articles/70/meandtheboy.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Me and RooTwo, him enjoying facing out in the sling."></a></div><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionNumber">1.</span> Roo, aka Lady Muck, clearly enjoying her time on the off-road explorers activity.<br><span class="m_figure__captionNumber">2.</span> Me and RooTwo, him enjoying facing out in the sling.</figcaption></figure><h2>Friday</h2><p>Our last day. Sad to be leaving but grateful for the time with my family. We headed for the park to make the most of our last few hours. <em>RooTwo</em> had his first go on a swing. I’m not sure how much he enjoyed it, although <em>Roo</em> certainly did.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--poke-both"><a href="/images/articles/70/large_rootwoswing.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/70/rootwoswing.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Katie and Roo enjoying pushing RooTwo on his first swing experience."></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Katie and Roo enjoying pushing RooTwo on his first swing experience.</figcaption></figure></article></div></div></main><section class="c_aside" role="complementary"><div class="c_aside__content"><div class="c_grid c_grid--prose"><div class="m_cloud"><p class="m_cloud__title">Tagged:</p><ol class="m_cloud__items"><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/family" title="View all content tagged family"><span class="m_tag__name">family</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/holiday" title="View all content tagged holiday"><span class="m_tag__name">holiday</span></a></li></ol></div><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/69">Exploring Sussex: Lewes</a></div></nav></div></div></section><footer class="c_footer"><div class="c_footer__content"><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--inline-bleached"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link" title="Pattern library"><span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/tags" class="m_navigation__link" title="Tags"><span class="m_navigation__title">Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav><div class="c_footer__copyright">&copy; Jon J Roobottom</div></div></footer><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu" style="display: none"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><header class="c_header"><div class="c_header__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span></a></div><a class="m_menuControl m_menuControl--open" href="#main-menu" data-fullscreen-close="#main-menu"><span class="m_menuControl__icon"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_icon--small"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg> </span><span class="m_menuControl__label">Close</span></a></div></header><main class="c_page"><div class="c_page__content"><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--chunky"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link" title="Home"><span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link m_navigation__link--current" title="Articles"><span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></main></div></div><script src="/loadlater.js"></script><script src="//static.getclicky.com/js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">try{ clicky.init(101098446); }catch(e){}</script></body></html>
