She had a brilliant time! Here’s some of the things we liked:</p><h2>Flying</h2><p>In contrast to the last time we flew with <em>Roo</em>, this time we’d deliberately not booked flights which demanded us be at the airport at some ungodly hour. This meant that she wasn’t tired and therefore in a good mood.</p><p>We were also a lot more prepared this time, we didn’t forget to bring her headphones or iPad pre-loaded with Peppa Pig.</p><p>The weather on the way out made for an especially memorable flight over the Alps. I really love this picture of <em>Roo</em>, captivated by the view:</p><figure class="m_figure"><div class="m_figure__gallery" data-gallery><a href="/images/articles/63/large_roo-alps.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="900" data-height="1600"><img src="/images/articles/63/roo-alps.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Roo, captivated by the view of the Alps from 38,000 ft"> </a><a href="/images/articles/63/large_alps.jpg" class="m_figure__item" data-gallery-item data-width="3995" data-height="2996"><img src="/images/articles/63/alps.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="The view of the Alps"></a></div><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionNumber">1.</span> Roo, captivated by the view of the Alps from 38,000 ft<br><span class="m_figure__captionNumber">2.</span> The view of the Alps</figcaption></figure><h2>Our house</h2><p>Our little home from home wasn’t so little! Being early in the season meant we picked up a bargain, and we’re able to stay in a massive country villa with amazing views. <em>Roo</em> especially loved the large fenced gardens, meaning she could tear around outside in relative safety. Being independent is increasingly important to her at the moment, so this was great.</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_house.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/house.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Our villa for the week in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, Lucca"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Our villa for the week in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, Lucca</figcaption></figure><h2>Pisa</h2><p>Although she quite enjoyed having her picture taken holding up the leaning tower, Pisa isn’t the most relaxing place to visit with a small child. We spent a few hours here, but any more would’ve pushed <em>Roo</em> over the edge and into the canyon of tantrum.</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_leaning-tower.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/leaning-tower.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Of course we had to take this shot of the Leaning Tower"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Of course we had to take this shot of the Leaning Tower</figcaption></figure><p>One thing we <em>did</em> really like here was the Botanical Gardens. These we’re uncrowded and gave <em>Roo</em> ample room to run around amongst the beautiful flowers. If you find yourself in Pisa with a small child, seek them out. For only €4 an adult, they’re the perfect antidote to the crowds in the Square of Miracles.</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_gardens-pisa.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/gardens-pisa.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Grandma and Roo enjoying the shade in the Botanical Gardens in Pisa"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Grandma and Roo enjoying the shade in the Botanical Gardens in Pisa</figcaption></figure><h2>Lucca</h2><p>Lucca is a fabulous place. We spent a couple of different days here, the first time just for a few hours to grab lunch and explore until the inevitable tiredness-time-bomb went off and a screaming child forced us home for tea.</p><p>The second time, while my mum and dad went off to Florence, Katie, <em>Roo</em> and I spent a whole day here. We hired a side-by-side bicycle, which she <em>loved</em>, shouting “ciao” at passers-by.</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_bike-in-lucca.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/bike-in-lucca.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Katie and Roo cycling on the walls of Lucca."></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Katie and Roo cycling on the walls of Lucca.</figcaption></figure><p>We had more pizza outside at a <a href="http://www.ristorantesancolombanolucca.it/en/">lovely restaurant</a> where the staff we’re amazing with <em>Roo</em>, bringing her food out extremely quickly. This is mission critical, as I’m sure anyone with a hungry toddler in a public place will know.</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_lunch-in-lucca.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/lunch-in-lucca.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Enjoying some Pizza at Ristorante San Colombano, Lucca"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Enjoying some Pizza at Ristorante San Colombano, Lucca</figcaption></figure><p>After lunch, with <em>Roo</em> asleep in the push-chair, we explored the tiny winding streets. It was idilic in the afternoon sun. Katie went off to shop, and I took the opportunity to climb the recently restored <em>Torre Delle Ore</em>. The effort of climbing the 470 steps was rewarded at the top with an amazing view of the whole city and surrounding hills.</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_lucca-skyline.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/lucca-skyline.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="The view from the top of the Torre Delle Ore, Lucca"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">The view from the top of the Torre Delle Ore, Lucca</figcaption></figure><p><em>Roo</em> woke up on the way back to the car, just as we were passing the merry go round. “I go on that?” she said. How could we refuse?</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_merry-go-round.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/merry-go-round.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Katie and Roo enjoying the Merry-go-round, goodness knows who she’s waving at"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Katie and Roo enjoying the Merry-go-round, goodness knows who she’s waving at</figcaption></figure><p>I’d highly recommend Lucca as an easy city to visit with a toddler. It had none of the crowds of Pisa, and felt an altogether more chilled out place.</p><h2>In summary</h2><p>We really hit the jackpot with both the location and weather for our week in northern Tuscany. There’s lot to enjoy for little people in this region if you’re prepared to miss out on some of the more famous places, and go where the crowds aren’t. We certainly had a brilliant time!</p><figure class="m_figure"><a href="/images/articles/63/large_last-day.jpg" class="m_figure__item"><img src="/images/articles/63/last-day.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Katie, my dad and mum in the grounds of our villa on the last day"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Katie, my dad and mum in the grounds of our villa on the last day</figcaption></figure></article></div></div></main><section class="c_aside" role="complementary"><div class="c_aside__content"><div class="c_grid c_grid--prose"><div class="m_cloud"><p class="m_cloud__title">Tagged:</p><ol class="m_cloud__items"><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/travel" title="View all content tagged travel"><span class="m_tag__name">travel</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/italy" title="View all content tagged italy"><span class="m_tag__name">italy</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/toddlers" title="View all content tagged toddlers"><span class="m_tag__name">toddlers</span></a></li></ol></div><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/62">SOHN live at the Electric in Brixton</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/65">Into Eternity</a></div></nav></div></div></section><footer class="c_footer"><div class="c_footer__content"><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--inline-bleached"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link" title="Pattern library"><span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/tags" class="m_navigation__link" title="Tags"><span class="m_navigation__title">Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav><div class="c_footer__copyright">&copy; Jon J Roobottom</div></div></footer><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu" style="display: none"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><header class="c_header"><div class="c_header__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span></a></div><a class="m_menuControl m_menuControl--open" href="#main-menu" data-fullscreen-close="#main-menu"><span class="m_menuControl__icon"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_icon--small"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg> </span><span class="m_menuControl__label">Close</span></a></div></header><main class="c_page"><div class="c_page__content"><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--chunky"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link" title="Home"><span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link m_navigation__link--current" title="Articles"><span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></main></div></div><script src="/loadlater.js"></script><script src="//static.getclicky.com/js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">try{ clicky.init(101098446); }catch(e){}</script></body></html>
